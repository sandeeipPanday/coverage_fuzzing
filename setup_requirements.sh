ðŸ§ª To Run It
chmod +x setup_requirements.sh
./setup_requirements.sh


Pro Tip: you can comment out anything you donâ€™t need yetâ€”like the LangChain or OpenAI linesâ€”if you're not diving into that part just yet.

Would you like me to generate a requirements.txt alongside this for CI/CD purposes? Or even bundle a Makefile to run your whole fuzz-report pipeline in one go? Iâ€™d be happy to wire it up for smooth automation.
