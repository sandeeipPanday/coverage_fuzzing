Subject: Fuzzing Framework Evaluation – Progress and Ongoing Direction
Dear Team,
I’d like to provide a brief update on our current efforts toward designing a fuzzing test framework that supports structured input validation, edge-case exploration, and potential integration with our broader security pipelines.
We began by exploring a function-level approach—extracting standalone functions from the codebase and using byte-oriented fuzzing with Atheris to identify inputs that trigger unexpected behavior. This gave us early visibility into stability gaps and exposed areas sensitive to malformed inputs. Complementary edge testing helped assess how functions perform under stress conditions such as oversized buffers or binary payloads.
Based on these initial findings, we’ve started evaluating a more modular and extensible strategy focused on class-based fuzzing. This involves identifying class methods, instantiating objects, and injecting test inputs directly into method interfaces. Our goal is to uncover failures that only arise through stateful logic or multi-step method interactions. We’re also experimenting with per-method input configurations to guide fuzzing more effectively.
This framework is still under active development, and we’re assessing its suitability across different types of code and architectures. Some components may require further refinement or additional scaffolding depending on how individual projects are structured. As we continue validating these approaches, we anticipate that each application or service will require dedicated effort and resources to customize and extend the framework appropriately.
We’ll share further updates as we converge on recommended practices, tooling decisions, and rollout guidelines. Your feedback and insights are always welcome as we evaluate and build toward a robust solution.
Best regards,
Sandeep
