Subject: Summary of Fuzzing Framework Implementation and Refactoring
Hi [Team/Recipient Name],
I wanted to share a concise overview of the fuzzing test framework we've implemented so far, along with the refinements that were made to align it with more modular, maintainable, and realistic testing of our Python codebase.

‚úÖ Phase 1: Initial Fuzzing Approach (Function-Level)
- Function Discovery: Used detect_functions.py to parse all .py files under api/ and extract standalone function definitions.
- Byte-Level Fuzzing: Implemented fuzz_runner.py with Atheris to inject random bytes into each function and capture crash data.
- Edge Testing: Created manual_edge_tests.py to run functions against hard-coded edge inputs like empty strings, large payloads, and binary sequences.
- Crash Logging & Reports: Logged structured results into fuzz_log.jsonl and visualized with generate_html_report.py, including a pie chart of pass/fail ratios.

üöÄ Phase 2: Evolved Class-Based Fuzzing Strategy
- Class Method Detection: Refactored detect_functions.py into detect_methods.py, parsing ClassDef AST nodes and capturing method names, excluding __init__.
- Instance Creation + Fuzzing: fuzz_runner.py now instantiates each class and calls its methods with fuzzed input, assuming default constructor compatibility.
- CLI Integration: Created fuzzing_cli.py for unified execution of all modules:
- Detect methods
- Configure expected input types
- Run Atheris fuzzing
- Execute edge case testing
- Generate final report
- First-Time Configuration: Added configure_methods.py to prompt for per-method input types (str, int, json, etc.), saved to fuzz_config.json.
- Corpus & Execution Caps: Applied safety constraints to prevent runaway corpus growth and capped fuzzing at 5,000 iterations by default.
- Dockerization: Built a Dockerfile to containerize the framework for CI/CD compatibility and reproducible test environments.

üìÅ Artifacts & Output
- fuzz_log.jsonl ‚Äî crash data with stacktrace + input
- fuzz_config.json ‚Äî one-time setup inputs per method
- fuzz_report.html ‚Äî pass/fail stats, test types, and circular pie chart
- corpus/ ‚Äî captured crash inputs with execution timestamps

Let me know if you'd like access to the container image or help integrating it into our GitLab pipeline. We can also extend the input generator layer for structured types like nested JSON or sequence-based testing with Hypothesis.
Best regards,
Sandeep

Would you like me to prefill the recipient line or adapt this to a shared doc layout if you're publishing it internally?
